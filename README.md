“The Spark” is a cutting-edge e-learning platform designed to broaden your learning journey. Whether you're a student eager to expand your knowledge, an instructor passionate about sharing expertise, or an organization looking to empower your workforce, The Spark has something for everyone. Before registering for courses, students must create an account on the platform. They create a username and password used to login. After providing additional information such as address and phone number, a student is officially enrolled and provided a unique Student ID. 
Upon enrollment, students are free to register for any number of courses. The Spark has a diverse selection of courses listed on the platform. Courses are uniquely identified by a course ID. Students can see key information about the course prior to registering. Listed on the platform is the name of the course, a short description, as well as its  difficulty level so students know what to expect. Students are also able to see the name of the professor that will be teaching the course. 
Before they start taking classes, students must pay registration fees and course fees. Course fees are based on the number and type of courses students take. Some students choose to pay their fees in one installment. Others opt into a payment plan. Invoices are emailed to students and each invoice is assigned a unique invoice ID. Listed on the invoice are the date of issue, total balance to be paid and method of payment. If a student opts into a payment plan, listed on the invoice is the credit balance. If a student has opted to pay in one installment, that credit balance defaults to $0.
 At The Spark, instructors are specialists in the subject they teach and as such, every course is taught by one instructor. Instructors only teach one course they are specialized in. Instructors are identified by a unique instructor ID. The platform keeps track of the name of the instructor, their phone number, address, and qualifications. Instructors are paid on a weekly basis via a physical paycheck. One paycheck corresponds to one instructor. Paychecks are distributed to instructors based on the instructor ID listed on them. 
Classes are carried out in an online session where students and instructors meet in a one on one appointment. Students can have multiple appointments set up per week, for different courses,  and instructors can also have multiple one on one appointments per workday, teaching different students throughout the week. After many online appointments for a course, a final assessment is administered to test the students mastery of the course. Assessments have a unique Assessment ID. Each assessment has a formal title, score required to pass, time limit, and due date. One assessment is administered to one student. Considering a student can take multiple courses, each with its own final assessment, a student may end up taking multiple final assessments during their time on The Spark.
